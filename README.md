Big data tools setup on Docker for studying them.

This project is my attempt to study data tools and architectures before I go to cloud. Some of them I plan studying are:

I know my MinIO credentials are all over my project and I should protect them in any real scenario. I just prefer this so I can retrive them faster if I need.

Spark
MinIO (bc is simmilar to S3)
Airflow (the only orchestrator I know)
Kafka
